Answer to the reviewer who wrote BBG-Report.

Thanks for all the constructive criticism! We have brought in Mike Shulman
as a co-author to help us address point (2).

The few points that have not led to changes in the text are addressed below.

(4.3) Does the proof construct an inverse equivalence?
Or does it reduce the statement that blah is an equivalence to the case
where blah is the identity function?

R: The latter is indeed a high-level description of what happens in the proof.
However, any proof that a function is an equivalence constructs
implicitly its inverse.

Same questions for the proof of 4.9.

R: This lemma, now 3.10, is not about an equivalence but about an
identity between two paths over a path. Is there some misunderstanding here?

(p11) It wasnâ€™t clear to me why Q_p(X,f) is a proposition.

R: This is completely non-trivial, and the hard core of the proof.
