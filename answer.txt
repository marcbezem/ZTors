Answer to the reviewer who wrote BBG-Report.

Thanks for all the constructive criticism! The few points that have
not led to changes in the text (all in red) are addressed below.

(p2) The ∞-topos motivation for this work could be discussed in a paragraph
right above “Now we give a few more details.”

Ulrik, did you make up your mind about whether you would write something?

(4.3) Does the proof construct an inverse equivalence? 
Or does it reduce the statement that blah is an equivalence to the case 
where blah is the identity function?

R: The latter is indeed a high-level description of what happens in the proof.
However, any proof that a function is an equivalence constructs 
implicitly its inverse.

Same questions for the proof of 4.9.

R: This lemma, now 2.9, is not about an equivalence but about an
identity between two paths over a path. Is there some misunderstanding here?

(p11) It wasn’t clear to me why Q_p(X,f) is a proposition.

R: This is completely non-trivial, and the hard core of the proof.

(§6) In the “future research,” what exactly are you hoping to prove about the type TG?

R: That TG satisfies the universal property of the direct product of circles,
one for each generator. The exact formulation, and certainly the proof,
are beyond the scope of our article - actually a research project in itself.
